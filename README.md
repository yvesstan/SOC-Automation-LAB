# SOC-Automation-LAB

# Objective

The SOC Automation Lab project was a pivotal element in my cybersecurity education. My main aim was to leverage this platform to develop practical skills in the automation of security operations. The hands-on experience gained from orchestrating the interplay between different security tools not only enriched my technical knowledge but also enhanced my ability to employ automation to expedite threat detection and response. This initiative has been integral in reinforcing my understanding of the security operations framework and in developing my competencies as a security analyst.

## Skills Learned

- Enhanced skills in detecting network abnormalities and executing prompt and effective response mechanisms to mitigate threats.
- Developed the ability to automate security processes, significantly improving operational efficiency and reducing manual error.
- Script development for specific threat detection, including crafting custom scripts to identify and mitigate the use of sophisticated tools like Mimikatz, enhancing the SOC's capability to tackle advanced cybersecurity threats.
- Acquired a systematic approach to incident logging, analysis, and management, ensuring organized and strategic responses to security events.
- Honed skills in utilizing threat intelligence platforms for deeper analysis of potential and actual security threats, improving alert accuracy and threat mitigation.
- Gained practical experience in configuring and managing security infrastructure in various environments, including cloud platforms, to support robust SOC operations.
- Enhanced proficiency in integrating and managing various operating systems within the SOC environment, ensuring a comprehensive security posture.

## Tools Used
